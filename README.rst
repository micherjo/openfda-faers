Exploratory project based on OpenFDA API for FAERS database containing reports with drugs and adverse reaction events observed in patients.

Python 3.6+ code and analysis results are available in form of a Jupyter notebook.  Description of the required Python environment and package dependencies are provided in *environment.yml*.
On top of this page there are links to Binder2 an Google Collab clouds, where an image with all the requirements in place could be instantiated. Running the notebook requires internet connection to access the web API.

A copy is also available in html format if github notebook rendering does not work for some reason.
